constraints:
  class_weight: {descp: 'dict, list of dicts, "balanced", or None, optional Weights
      associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``. If not given,
      all classes are supposed to have weight one. For multi-output problems, a list
      of dicts can be provided in the same order as the columns of y. Note that for
      multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be defined for each class
      of every column in its own dict. For example, for four-class multilabel classification
      weights should be [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead
      of [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}]. The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to
      automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in
      the input data: ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``. For multi-output,
      the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.'}
  indices: {default: None, descp: 'array-like, shape (n_subsample,), or None Array
      of indices to be used in a subsample. Can be of length less than n_samples in
      the case of a subsample, or equal to n_samples in the case of a bootstrap subsample
      with repeated indices. If None, the sample weight will be calculated over the
      full sample. Only "balanced" is supported for class_weight if this is provided.'}
  y: {descp: 'array-like of shape (n_samples,) or (n_samples, n_outputs) Array of
      original class labels per sample.'}
