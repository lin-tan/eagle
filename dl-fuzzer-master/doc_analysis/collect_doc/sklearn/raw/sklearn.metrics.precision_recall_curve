sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_curve = precision_recall_curve(y_true, probas_pred, pos_label=None, sample_weight=None)
    Compute precision-recall pairs for different probability thresholds
    
    Note: this implementation is restricted to the binary classification task.
    
    The precision is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fp)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fp`` the number of false positives. The precision is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample
    that is negative.
    
    The recall is the ratio ``tp / (tp + fn)`` where ``tp`` is the number of
    true positives and ``fn`` the number of false negatives. The recall is
    intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples.
    
    The last precision and recall values are 1. and 0. respectively and do not
    have a corresponding threshold.  This ensures that the graph starts on the
    y axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : array, shape = [n_samples]
        True binary labels. If labels are not either {-1, 1} or {0, 1}, then
        pos_label should be explicitly given.
    
    probas_pred : array, shape = [n_samples]
        Estimated probabilities or decision function.
    
    pos_label : int or str, default=None
        The label of the positive class.
        When ``pos_label=None``, if y_true is in {-1, 1} or {0, 1},
        ``pos_label`` is set to 1, otherwise an error will be raised.
    
    sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Sample weights.
    
    Returns
    -------
    precision : array, shape = [n_thresholds + 1]
        Precision values such that element i is the precision of
        predictions with score >= thresholds[i] and the last element is 1.
    
    recall : array, shape = [n_thresholds + 1]
        Decreasing recall values such that element i is the recall of
        predictions with score >= thresholds[i] and the last element is 0.
    
    thresholds : array, shape = [n_thresholds <= len(np.unique(probas_pred))]
        Increasing thresholds on the decision function used to compute
        precision and recall.
