constraints:
  block_size:
    descp: An int that is >= 2.
  input:
    descp: A Tensor. 4-D with shape [batch, height, width, depth].
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  paddings:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. 2-D tensor
      of non-negative integers with shape [2, 2]. It specifies the padding of the
      input with zeros across the spatial dimensions as follows: paddings = [[pad_top,
      pad_bottom], [pad_left, pad_right]] The effective spatial dimensions of the
      zero-padded input tensor will be: height_pad = pad_top + height + pad_bottom
      width_pad = pad_left + width + pad_right The attr block_size must be greater
      than one. It indicates the block size. Non-overlapping blocks of size block_size
      x block size in the height and width dimensions are rearranged into the batch
      dimension at each location. The batch of the output tensor is batch * block_size
      * block_size. Both height_pad and width_pad must be divisible by block_size.
      The shape of the output will be: [batchblock_sizeblock_size, height_pad/block_size,
      width_pad/block_size, depth] Some examples: (1) For the following input of shape
      [1, 2, 2, 1] and block_size of 2: x = [[[[1], [2]], [[3], [4]]]] The output
      tensor has shape [4, 1, 1, 1] and value: [[[[1]]], [[[2]]], [[[3]]], [[[4]]]]
      (2) For the following input of shape [1, 2, 2, 3] and block_size of 2: x = [[[[1,
      2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]]] The output tensor has shape [4,
      1, 1, 3] and value: [[[[1, 2, 3]]], [[[4, 5, 6]]], [[[7, 8, 9]]], [[[10, 11,
      12]]]] (3) For the following input of shape [1, 4, 4, 1] and block_size of 2:
      x = [[[[1], [2], [3], [4]], [[5], [6], [7], [8]], [[9], [10], [11], [12]], [[13],
      [14], [15], [16]]]] The output tensor has shape [4, 2, 2, 1] and value: x =
      [[[[1], [3]], [[9], [11]]], [[[2], [4]], [[10], [12]]], [[[5], [7]], [[13],
      [15]]], [[[6], [8]], [[14], [16]]]] (4) For the following input of shape [2,
      2, 4, 1] and block_size of 2: x = [[[[1], [2], [3], [4]], [[5], [6], [7], [8]]],
      [[[9], [10], [11], [12]], [[13], [14], [15], [16]]]] The output tensor has shape
      [8, 1, 2, 1] and value: x = [[[[1], [3]]], [[[9], [11]]], [[[2], [4]]], [[[10],
      [12]]], [[[5], [7]]], [[[13], [15]]], [[[6], [8]]], [[[14], [16]]]] Among others,
      this operation is useful for reducing atrous convolution into regular convolution.'
