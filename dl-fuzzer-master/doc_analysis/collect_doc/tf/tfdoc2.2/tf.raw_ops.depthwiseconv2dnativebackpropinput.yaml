constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NHWC
    descp: 'An optional string from: "NHWC", "NCHW". Defaults to "NHWC". Specify the
      data format of the input and output data. With the default format "NHWC", the
      data is stored in the order of: [batch, height, width, channels]. Alternatively,
      the format could be "NCHW", the data storage order of: [batch, channels, height,
      width].'
  dilations:
    default: '[1, 1, 1, 1]'
    descp: An optional list of ints. Defaults to [1, 1, 1, 1]. 1-D tensor of length
      4. The dilation factor for each dimension of input. If set to k > 1, there will
      be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension. The dimension
      order is determined by the value of data_format, see above for details. Dilations
      in the batch and depth dimensions must be 1.
  filter:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, bfloat16, float32,
      float64. 4-D with shape [filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, depthwise_multiplier].'
  input_sizes:
    descp: A Tensor of type int32. An integer vector representing the shape of input,
      based on data_format. For example, if data_format is 'NHWC' then input is a
      4-D [batch, height, width, channels] tensor.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  out_backprop:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as filter. 4-D with shape based on data_format.
      For example, if data_format is 'NHWC' then out_backprop shape is [batch, out_height,
      out_width, out_channels]. Gradients w.r.t. the output of the convolution.
  padding:
    descp: 'A string from: "SAME", "VALID". The type of padding algorithm to use.'
  strides:
    descp: A list of ints. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of
      the input of the convolution.
inputs:
  optional:
  - data_format
  - dilations
  - name
  required:
  - input_sizes
  - filter
  - out_backprop
  - strides
  - padding
