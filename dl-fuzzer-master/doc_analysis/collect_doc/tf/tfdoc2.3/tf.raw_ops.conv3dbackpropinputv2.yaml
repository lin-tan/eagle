constraints:
  data_format:
    default: NDHWC
    descp: 'An optional string from: "NDHWC", "NCDHW". Defaults to "NDHWC". The data
      format of the input and output data. With the default format "NDHWC", the data
      is stored in the order of: [batch, in_depth, in_height, in_width, in_channels].
      Alternatively, the format could be "NCDHW", the data storage order is: [batch,
      in_channels, in_depth, in_height, in_width].'
  dilations:
    default: '[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]'
    descp: An optional list of ints. Defaults to [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. 1-D tensor of length
      5. The dilation factor for each dimension of input. If set to k > 1, there will
      be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension. The dimension
      order is determined by the value of data_format, see above for details. Dilations
      in the batch and depth dimensions must be 1.
  filter:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, bfloat16, float32,
      float64. Shape [depth, rows, cols, in_channels, out_channels]. in_channels must
      match between input and filter.'
  input_sizes:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. An integer
      vector representing the tensor shape of input, where input is a 5-D [batch,
      depth, rows, cols, in_channels] tensor.'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  out_backprop:
    descp: A Tensor. Must have the same type as filter. Backprop signal of shape [batch,
      out_depth, out_rows, out_cols, out_channels].
  padding:
    descp: 'A string from: "SAME", "VALID". The type of padding algorithm to use.'
  strides:
    descp: A list of ints that has length >= 5. 1-D tensor of length 5. The stride
      of the sliding window for each dimension of input. Must have strides[0] = strides[4]
      = 1.
inputs:
  optional:
  - data_format
  - dilations
  - name
  required:
  - input_sizes
  - filter
  - out_backprop
  - strides
  - padding
