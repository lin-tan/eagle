constraints:
  input:
    descp: A Tensor. Input tensor, to be summarized by the op.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_dtype:
    default: tf.dtypes.float32
    descp: 'An optional tf.DType from: tf.float32, tf.float64. Defaults to tf.float32.
      Optional. The type of the output. Can be float32 or float64 (default: float32).'
  tensor_debug_mode:
    default: '-1'
    descp: 'An optional int. Defaults to -1. Tensor debug mode: the mode in which
      the input tensor is summarized by the op. See the TensorDebugMode enum in tensorflow/core/protobuf/debug_event.proto
      for details. Supported values: 2 (CURT_HEALTH): Output a float32/64 tensor of
      shape [2]. The 1st element is the tensor_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise.
      The 2nd element is a bit which is set to 1 if the input tensor has an infinity
      or nan value, or zero otherwise. 3 (CONCISE_HEALTH): Output a float32/64 tensor
      of shape [5]. The 1st element is the tensor_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise.
      The remaining four slots are the total number of elements, -infs, +infs, and
      nans in the input tensor respectively. 4 (FULL_HEALTH): Output a float32/64
      tensor of shape [11]. The 1st element is the tensor_id, if provided, and -1
      otherwise. The 2nd element is the device_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise.
      The 3rd element holds the datatype value of the input tensor as according to
      the enumerated type in tensorflow/core/framework/types.proto. The remaining
      elements hold the total number of elements, -infs, +infs, nans, negative finite
      numbers, zeros, and positive finite numbers in the input tensor respectively.
      5 (SHAPE): Output a float32/64 tensor of shape [10]. The 1st element is the
      tensor_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise. The 2nd element holds the datatype
      value of the input tensor as according to the enumerated type in tensorflow/core/framework/types.proto.
      The 3rd element holds the rank of the tensor. The 4th element holds the number
      of elements within the tensor. Finally the remaining 6 elements hold the shape
      of the tensor. If the rank of the tensor is lower than 6, the shape is right
      padded with zeros. If the rank is greater than 6, the head of the shape is truncated.
      6 (FULL_NUMERICS): Output a float32/64 tensor of shape [22]. The 1st element
      is the tensor_id, if provided, and -1 otherwise. The 2nd element is the device_id,
      if provided, and -1 otherwise. The 3rd element holds the datatype value of the
      input tensor as according to the enumerated type in tensorflow/core/framework/types.proto.
      The 4th element holds the rank of the tensor. The 5th to 11th elements hold
      the shape of the tensor. If the rank of the tensor is lower than 6, the shape
      is right padded with zeros. If the rank is greater than 6, the head of the shape
      is truncated. The 12th to 18th elements hold the number of elements, -infs,
      +infs, nans, denormal floats, negative finite numbers, zeros, and positive finite
      numbers in the input tensor respectively. The final four elements hold the min
      value, max value, mean, and variance of the input tensor. 8 (REDUCE_INF_NAN_THREE_SLOTS):
      Output a float32/64 tensor of shape [3]. The 1st element is -inf if any elements
      of the input tensor is -inf, or zero otherwise. The 2nd element is +inf if any
      elements of the input tensor is +inf, or zero otherwise. The 3rd element is
      nan if any element of the input tensor is nan, or zero otherwise.'
