constraints:
  binary_output:
    descp: A bool. Whether to output the number of occurrences of each value or 1.
  maxlength:
    default: '-1'
    descp: An optional int that is >= -1. Defaults to -1. Maximum value to count.
      Can be set to -1 for no maximum.
  minlength:
    default: '-1'
    descp: An optional int that is >= -1. Defaults to -1. Minimum value to count.
      Can be set to -1 for no minimum.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: A name for the operation (optional).
  splits:
    descp: A Tensor of type int64. Tensor containing the row splits of the ragged
      tensor to count.
  values:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. Tensor containing
      values of the sparse tensor to count.'
  weights:
    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64, float32, float64.
      A Tensor of the same shape as indices containing per-index weight values. May
      also be the empty tensor if no weights are used.'
