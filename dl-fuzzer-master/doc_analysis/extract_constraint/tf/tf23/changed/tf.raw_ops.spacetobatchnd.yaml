    descp: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. 2-D with shape

      the padding for input dimension i + 1, which corresponds to spatial dimension
      i. It is required that block_shape[i] divides input_shape[i + 1] + pad_start
      + pad_end. This operation is equivalent to the following steps: Zero-pad the
      start and end of dimensions [1, ..., M] of the input according to paddings to
      produce padded of shape padded_shape. Reshape padded to reshaped_padded of shape:
      [batch] + [padded_shape[1] / block_shape[0], block_shape[0], ..., padded_shape[M]
      / block_shape[M-1], block_shape[M-1]] + remaining_shape Permute dimensions of
      reshaped_padded to produce permuted_reshaped_padded of shape: block_shape +
      [batch] + [padded_shape[1] / block_shape[0], ..., padded_shape[M] / block_shape[M-1]]
      + remaining_shape Reshape permuted_reshaped_padded to flatten block_shape into
