constraints:
  combiner:
    default: None
    descp: A string specifying the reduction op. Currently "mean", "sqrtn" and "sum"
      are supported. "sum" computes the weighted sum of the embedding results for
      each row. "mean" is the weighted sum divided by the total weight. "sqrtn" is
      the weighted sum divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the
      weights. Defaults to mean.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    enum:
    - mean
    - sqrtn
    - sum
    ndim:
    - '0'
  max_norm:
    default: None
    descp: If not None, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger than this
      value, before combining.
  name:
    default: None
    descp: Optional name for the op.
    dtype:
    - tf.string
    ndim:
    - '0'
  params:
    descp: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a list of
      tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension, representing sharded
      embedding tensors following "div" partition strategy.
    structure:
    - list(tf.tensor)
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  sp_ids:
    descp: N x M SparseTensor of int64 ids where N is typically batch size and M is
      arbitrary.
    dtype:
    - tf.int64
  sp_weights:
    descp: either a SparseTensor of float / double weights, or None to indicate all
      weights should be taken to be 1. If specified, sp_weights must have exactly
      the same shape and indices as sp_ids.
    dtype:
    - float
    tensor_t:
    - SparseTensor
exceptions:
- TypeError: If sp_ids is not a SparseTensor, or if sp_weights is neither None nor
    SparseTensor.
- ValueError: If combiner is not one of {"mean", "sqrtn", "sum"}.

  - combiner

outputs:
- 'A dense tensor representing the combined embeddings for the sparse ids. For each
  row in the dense tensor represented by sp_ids, the op looks up the embeddings for
  all ids in that row, multiplies them by the corresponding weight, and combines these
  embeddings as specified. In other words, if shape(combined params) = [p0, p1, ...,
  pm] and shape(sp_ids) = shape(sp_weights) = [d0, d1] then shape(output) = [d0, p1,
  ..., pm]. For instance, if params is a 10x20 matrix, and sp_ids / sp_weights are
  [0, 0]: id 1, weight 2.0 [0, 1]: id 3, weight 0.5 [1, 0]: id 0, weight 1.0 [2, 3]:
  id 1, weight 3.0 with combiner="mean", then the output will be a 3x20 matrix where
  output[0, :] = (params[1, :] * 2.0 + params[3, :] * 0.5) / (2.0 + 0.5) output[1,
  :] = (params[0, :] * 1.0) / 1.0 output[2, :] = (params[1, :] * 3.0) / 3.0'
